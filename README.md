# Demand Forecasting Using ARIMA

This repository contains a project focused on **demand forecasting** using the **ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)** time series forecasting model. Demand forecasting is a crucial aspect of many industries, such as retail, manufacturing, and supply chain management, where predicting future demand is necessary for inventory management, production planning, and resource allocation.

## Introduction

Demand forecasting is essential for anticipating customer demand, optimizing operations, and reducing costs. In this project, the ARIMA model is used to predict future demand based on historical data. ARIMA is a popular model for time series forecasting because it captures important aspects of the data such as trend and seasonality.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a time series dataset containing historical demand data. It includes the following columns:
- **Date**: The date of the observation.
- **Demand**: The number of units demanded on that particular date.

You can either use the dataset provided in this repository or apply the model to your own data. Make sure your data follows a similar format.

## ARIMA Model

The **ARIMA** model is a time series forecasting technique that combines:
- **Auto-Regressive (AR)**: A model that uses the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations.
- **Integrated (I)**: It makes the series stationary by differencing the observations (i.e., subtracting an observation from an observation at the previous time step).
- **Moving Average (MA)**: A model that uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.

The ARIMA model is built with three hyperparameters: **p** (lag order), **d** (degree of differencing), and **q** (order of moving average).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Demand-Forecasting-Using-Arima.git
   cd Demand-Forecasting-Using-Arima
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation: Add your time series demand data into the data/ folder. Ensure that it is in a CSV format and properly formatted.

Jupyter Notebook: Run the notebooks/demand_forecasting_arima.ipynb notebook to explore the data, perform model fitting, and generate forecasts.

Alternatively, you can load the pre-trained ARIMA model (models/arima_model.pkl) and forecast using the model directly.

Model Training: Modify the ARIMA hyperparameters p, d, and q in the notebook to suit your dataset. You can also use the auto-ARIMA function to automatically find the best parameters.

Forecasting: The forecasted results will be saved in the results/forecast_results.csv file.

Plotting: The notebook also contains code to plot the historical data along with the predicted future values.

Results
The ARIMA model generates a forecast for future demand based on historical data. Example results include:

Time series plots showing actual vs. predicted values.
Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the model's performance.
